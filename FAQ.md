# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are the Waybar glyphs so small with the default font?

The default font is the _Cascadia Mono NF_ font which is the only Nerd Font included within the offical Fedora repositories.
The glyphs in this font are the same width as the rest of the font which makes them appear small in comparison to other [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

If larger glyphs are desired, then install the [CaskaydiaMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads#:~:text=CaskaydiaMono) or similar Nerd Fonts.

## Where are all the apps that are provided by default in Omarchy?

This is a conscious decision not to include all the applications and configuration options provided by Omarchy to minimise bloat and only install functionality that would be expected of a minimal desktop environment, leaving software installation choices to the user.

Many of these additional apps can be installed via the default official Fedora repositories or as a flatpak via [Flathub](https://flathub.org) if needed.
